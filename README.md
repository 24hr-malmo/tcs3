tcS3 -- STORE YOUR WP UPLOADS DIRECTLY ON S3

This alpha plugin is still being developed though it is found to be functional. This plugin will allow you to manage your media the way you always would with wordpress, but on the backend your dashboard will perform the operations on your S3 bucket saving you from having to sync or go through other painful processes to get your files to Amazon.
